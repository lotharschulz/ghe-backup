# Github Enterprise Backup

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zalando/ghe-backup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zalando/ghe-backup)        [![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/l/plug.svg)](https://github.com/zalando/ghe-backup/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)   

[Zalando Tech's ](https://tech.zalando.com/) [Github Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) backup approach.

## Overview
[Github Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) master and replica instances run on an AWS account. The same AWS account runs also a backup host. There is another backup host running in a different AWS account.

![overview](/Slide1.PNG "backup approach overview")

The [Taupage AMI](https://github.com/zalando-stups/taupage) is mandatory for backup hosts of [Zalando Tech's ](https://tech.zalando.com/) [Github Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/) for compliance reasons.
As [Taupage AMI](https://github.com/zalando-stups/taupage) is part of [Stups](https://stups.io/),  
other [Stups](https://stups.io/) technologies like [Senza](https://github.com/zalando-stups/senza) are also used.

Basically github's [backup-utils](https://github.com/github/backup-utils) are wrapped in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. An [EBS volume](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ebs/) stores the actual backup data.

### Create a docker image
```docker build --rm -t [repo name]:[tag] . ```  
e.g.  
```docker build --rm -t pierone.stups.zalan.do/bus/ghe-backup:0.0.7 . ```

#### run the image  
```docker run -d --name [repo name]:[tag] ```  
e.g.  
```docker run -d --name ghe-backup pierone.stups.zalan.do/bus/ghe-backup:0.0.7 ```

or with connected bash:  
```docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash --name [repo name]:[tag] ```    
e.g.  
```docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash --name ghe-backup pierone.stups.zalan.do/bus/ghe-backup:0.0.7 ```

##### attach to the running local container
```docker attach --sig-proxy=false [repo name] ```  
###### detach from the running local container (does not stop the container)
```CTRL+C ```  

##### run bash in running docker container
```sudo docker exec -i -t [ContainerID] bash ```
###### exit bash
```exit ```

#### upload Docker images to [pierone](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone) (a Zalando docker registry)
```docker push [repo name]:[tag]```  
e.g.  
```docker push pierone.stups.zalan.do/bus/ghe-backup:0.0.7```

### IAM [policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html) settings

A kms policy similar to the one shown below is needed to:   
* allow kms decryption of the encrypted ssh key
* access stups s3 bucket
* use EBS volume
```  
{  
    "Version": "2012-10-17",  
    "Statement": [  
        {  
            "Sid": "Stmt1441892073456",  
            "Effect": "Allow",  
            "Action": [  
                "kms:Decrypt"  
            ],  
            "Resource": [   
                "*"  
            ]  
        },  
        {  
            "Effect": "Allow",  
            "Action": [  
                "s3:GetObject"  
            ],  
            "Resource": [  
                "arn:aws:s3:::[yourMintBucket]/[repo name]/*"  
            ]  
        },  
        {  
            "Effect": "Allow",  
            "Action": [  
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",  
                "ec2:AttachVolume",  
                "ec2:DetachVolume"  
            ],  
            "Resource": "*"  
        }  
    ]  
}  
```   

Make sure you have an according [role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) managing your policy.

### configure an [EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ebs/) volume for backup data  

Backup data shall be saved on an [EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ebs/) volume to persist backups even if the backup instance goes down. Creation of such an ebs volume is described in Please follow these instructions: [senza's storage guild](https://docs.stups.io/en/latest/user-guide/storage.html) to create a regarding volume.  
Pls note: You need to format ([ebs-using-volumes](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html)) the EBS volume before you use it, otherwise you may experience issues like:  
[_You must specify the file type_](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=450413).  

### Senza yaml file
[Stups](https://stups.io/) requires a [senza yaml file](http://docs.stups.io/en/latest/components/senza.html#senza-info)
to deploy something to AWS. This yaml file gets basically translated to
[AWS CloudFormation templates ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-guide.html)
that causes a stack being deployed.

A sample senza yaml file would be:  
```  
# basic information for generating and executing this definition   
SenzaInfo:  
  StackName: hello-world  
  Parameters:  
    - ImageVersion:
        Description: "Docker image version of hello-world."
# a list of senza components to apply to the definition
SenzaComponents:
  # this basic configuration is required for the other components
  - Configuration:
      Type: Senza::StupsAutoConfiguration # auto-detect network setup
      AvailabilityZones: [myAZ] # use EBS volume's AZ
  # will create a launch configuration and auto scaling group with scaling triggers
  - AppServer:
      Type: Senza::TaupageAutoScalingGroup
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      SecurityGroups:
        - app-{{Arguments.ApplicationId}}
      IamRoles:
        - app-{{Arguments.ApplicationId}}
      AssociatePublicIpAddress: false # change for standalone deployment in default VPC
      TaupageConfig:
        application_version: "{{Arguments.ImageVersion}}"
        runtime: Docker
        source: "stups/hello-world:{{Arguments.ImageVersion}}"
        mint_bucket: "{{Arguments.MintBucket}}"
        kms_private_ssh_key: "aws:kms:myAWSregion:123456789:key/myrandomstringwithnumbers123456567890"
        volumes:
          ebs:
            /dev/sdf: my-volume
        mounts:
          /data:
            partition: /dev/xvdf  
```
_If you copy/paste the template above, make sure your details replace the dummy values_  


### Create scm-source.json
Ghe-backup uses a bash script similar to
[stups application-development](http://docs.stups.io/en/latest/user-guide/application-development.html) to generate a scm-source.json file.   
Make sure the bash script is executable:  
```chmod +x create-scm-source.sh ```  
and run it like:  
```./create-scm-source.sh ```  


## Tests
There are two kinds of tests available:
* python nose tests
* bash tests

Both can be run with ```./run-tests.sh ```.  
Pls note:

* kms tests don't run on ci environments as it requires aws logins e.g. via mai
* *make sure* you run ```bashtest/cleanup-tests.sh```  in order to clean up afterwards.

### nosetest
* precondition: you are logged in with AWS e.g.  
```mai login [awsaccount-role] ```  
* test run:  
```nosetests -w python -v --nocapture testdecryptkms.py ```  

### bash tests
Pls go to bashtest directory:
``` cd bashtest ``` and run the tests:  
``` ./test-convert-kms-private-ssh-key.sh ```  
``` ./test-delete-instuck-progress.sh ```  

*Make sure* you run ```./cleanup-tests.sh ``` in order to clean up afterwards.
